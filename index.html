<p>I am a 4th year graduate student from National University of Singapore under supervision of Wee Teck Gan. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. from Peking University.</p>

<p>I am working on representation theory and number theory, especially in Langlands program, automorphic representations and Galois cohomology.</p>

<p>
Currently, I am exploring several aspects of disconnected reductive groups over p-adic fields and number fields. Tasho Kaletha has formulated an LLC conjecture for disconnected reductive groups (of certain type). 
</p>
<p>
(1) Following Kaletha's pioneering work, we are attempting to formulate a general conjectural global multiplicity formula (of determining multiplicity of automorphic representations in the discrete spectrum in terms of the LLC) for disconnected reductive groups. 
</p>
<p>
(2) As evidence, for disconnected tori, we have established a multiplicity formula, using Galois (hyper)cohomology and a reformulation of Kaletha's LLC for disconnected tori. Another evidence comes from the known results of Arthur's multiplicity formula for orthogonal groups. 
</p>
<p>
(3) I am currently learning moduli interpretation of LLC from [FS21] and [DHKM20], etc., and another goal I am pursuing is to extend their work to disconnected setting.
